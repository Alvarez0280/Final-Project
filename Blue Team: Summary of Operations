Description of Targets
TODO: Answer the questions below.
The target of this attack was: Target 1 (192.168.1.110). Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:
Monitoring the Targets
Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:


Excessive HTTP Errors
WHEN count() GROUPED OVER top 5 ‘http.response.status_code’ IS ABOVE 400 FOR THE LAST 5 minutes
Metric: WHEN count() GROUPED OVER top 5 ‘http.response.status_code’
Threshold: IS ABOVE 400 FOR THE LAST 5 minutes
Vulnerability Mitigated: 
Reliability: High.
HTTP Request Size Monitor
WHEN sum() of http.request.bytes OVER all documents IS ABOVE 3500 FOR THE LAST 1 minute
Metric: WHEN sum() of http.request.byte OVER all documents
Threshold: IS ABOVE 3500
Vulnerability Mitigated: 
Reliability: Medium. This alert could create false positives.
CPU Usage Monitor
WHEN max() OF system.process.cpu.total.pct OVER all documents IS ABOVE 0.5 FOR THE LAST 5 minutes
Metric: WHEN max() OF system.process.cpu.total.pct OVER all documents
Threshold: IS ABOVE 0.5
Vulnerability Mitigated: 
Reliability: HIGH
